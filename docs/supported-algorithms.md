# Supported PQC Algorithms <!-- omit from toc -->

## Support Overview <!-- omit from toc -->
This document outlines the Key Exchange Mechanisms (KEM) and digital signature algorithms supported in this project based on the upstream cryptographic dependencies (liboqs, OQS-Provider, and OpenSSL). It also details exclusions and the rationale behind them.

The PQC-Evaluation-Tools project provides support for all the PQC algorithms provided by its various dependency libraries. However, there are some exceptions to this which are detailed in the following subsections. For detailed information of the algorithms this project supports, please refer to the following dependency library documentation:

- [Liboqs Supported Algorithms](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-algorithms)
- [OpenSSL Supported PQC Algorithms](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/tag/openssl-3.5.0)
- [OQS-Provider Supported Algorithms](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/ALGORITHMS.md)

## Liboqs Algorithms

### Algorithm Support Summary
The PQC-Evaluation-Tools project supports all key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms provided by liboqs, with two notable exceptions:

- **HQC** and its variants are excluded by default due to a known IND-CCA2 vulnerability in the current implementation of Liboqs. As a result, HQC is not enabled for performance benchmarking unless explicitly configured by the user.

- **Falcon** digital signature variants are not compatible with **memory profiling on ARM systems** due to issues between the scheme’s structure and the Valgrind Massif tool. This does not affect general functional testing or result parsing, which remain fully supported across all platforms.

These exceptions are reflected in the support tables below. For users who wish to enable HQC despite the security risk, configuration instructions are provided in the advanced setup guide.

For additional information, please refer to the following documentation:

- See the [Advanced Setup Configuration Guide](../advanced-setup-configuration.md) for instructions on enabling HQC.
- Refer to the [Disclaimer Document](../../DISCLAIMER.md) for security warnings and usage guidance.

## OpenSSL Algorithms

### Algorithm Support Summary
OpenSSL 3.5.0 introduces native support for the NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms **ML-KEM**, **ML-DSA**, and **SLH-DSA**. This project integrates these algorithms for TLS benchmarking where possible. However, some limitations affect their usage in performance testing and handshake scenarios:

#### Known Limitations
- **ML-DSA** and **SLH-DSA** are currently not supported by the OpenSSL `speed` utility, making them unavailable for cryptographic performance benchmarking.

- **SLH-DSA** is supported at the provider level (e.g., for generating X.509 certificates) but is not yet integrated into the OpenSSL TLS stack (`s_client`, `s_server`, or `speed`). Its future integration into TLS 1.3 is being tracked via this [IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reddy-tls-slhdsa-01). Until then, SPHINCS+ from the OQS-Provider will be used as a placeholder for stateless hash-based signatures in TLS tests.
  
- The **X448MLKEM1024** Hybrid-PQC KEM is implemented and supported by OpenSSL's `speed` tool but not registered as a TLS group. It is excluded from handshake testing, though it remains available for standalone benchmarking and non-TLS evaluations.

#### Classical Algorithm Benchmarks
To provide performance baselines for comparison, classical algorithms are also included in TLS benchmarking:

- RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096
- prime256v1, secp384r1, secp521r1

These schemes help assess the overhead and feasibility of PQC adoption in real-world contexts.

## OQS-Provider Algorithms

### Algorithm Support Summary
The majority of algorithms provided by the OQS-Provider are supported by this project for automated TLS handshake testing and cryptographic benchmarking. However, a small number of algorithms are explicitly excluded due to known incompatibilities with TLS 1.3 or unsupported behaviour in OpenSSL benchmarking tools.

#### Known Limitations
Certain digital signature schemes are excluded from TLS testing due to non-compliance with [RFC 8446](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446), which defines the requirements for signatures in TLS 1.3:

- **Most UOV-based schemes** (e.g., `OV_Is`, `OV_III`, and their hybrid variants)
- **CROSSrsdp256small**

These schemes remain available within the OQS-Provider for use in non-TLS contexts such as certificate generation or cryptographic benchmarking (e.g., via OpenSSL `speed`).

The following **UOV** algorithms do remain supported for TLS handshake testing:

- OV_Ip_pkc
- p256_OV_Ip_pkc
- OV_Ip_pkc_skc
- p256_OV_Ip_pkc_skc

#### OpenSSL 3.5.0 Compatibility
With the introduction of native PQC support in OpenSSL 3.5.0, the OQS-Provider automatically disables its own implementations of overlapping algorithms (e.g., ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) to avoid conflicts during provider initialization.
For further information on this, please refer to the following OQS-Provider documentation:

#### Additional Information
