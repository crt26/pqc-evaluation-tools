# Repository Directory Structure - fix and update directory listing

## Overview
This document outlines the directory structure of the `pqc-evaluation-tools` repository. It includes both the default contents available upon cloning and the directories/files that are dynamically generated during operation. 

Directories and files created by scripts during execution are marked with an asterisk (`*`) in the directory layout diagram.

## Layout and Descriptions
The `pqc-evaluation-tools` repository directories are organised as follows:

```
